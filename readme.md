Dear political action group,\
With the election season coming up, we understand you may be interested in developing a strategy for registering voters.

It may be efficient for a team of volunteers to target locations that have high foot traffic. For example, the subway stations in New York.

Leveraging MTA data, we can identify the time and location of high traffic areas. Furthermore, by combining this data with other sources, such as voter registration and demographic information, we can help you to target the population that most closely aligns with your purpose of reaching low income residents.

Regards,\
Data Team
